== SMTP configuration

To verify your xref:ROOT:dev-ops-guide/server-configuration/index.adoc#_email_sending[SMTP configuration], you can use this command:

[source,bash]
----
corteza-server auth test-notifications your-email@example.tld
----

The command sends a test email to the specified email address.
If your setup is valid and email sending was successful, you'll receive an email to the provided inbox.

[NOTE]
====
If you can't see the email, check the *spam folder* and *server logs*.
====

.Connection/authentication errors look like this:
[source,text]
----
could not send email: dial tcp [::1]:25: connect: connection refused
----
