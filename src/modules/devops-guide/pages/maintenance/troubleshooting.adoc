== Ports are not available

When you're running various services on your machine, it's common that the ports are already in use.
You will see something like this:

[source]
----
Cannot start service server: Ports are not available: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:18080: bind: address already in use
----

If you see this error, you can change the port number to something between `1024` and `65535`.
You can also replace the value for `services.server.ports` in `docker-compose.yaml` to `["80"]`, and Docker will pick an available port for you.

⚠️ Make sure also to change the port everywhere else.

== Connection to {APP_AUTOMATION} server

You might see one or more connection refused errors in server container logs (`docker-compose logs -f server`):

[source]
----
{"level":"error","ts":1608125024.4714684,"logger":"corredor","caller":"corredor/service.go:427","msg":"could not load corredor server scripts","error":"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest balancer error: connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 172.23.0.2:80: connect: connection refused\"","stacktrace":"github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-server/pkg/corredor.(*service).loadServerScripts\n\t/drone/src/pkg/corredor/service.go:427"}
----

If there are a couple of errors when the server is starting up, that's ok.
Sometimes it takes more time to start up {APP_AUTOMATION} server, and {PRODUCT_NAME} server can not yet connect to it.

If the problem persists, and you can see {APP_AUTOMATION} state as healthy, verify the changes you might have made to the configuration.

== Network proxy declared as external

[source]
----
ERROR: Network proxy declared as external, but could not be found. Please create the network manually using `docker network create proxy` and try again.
----

Make sure your nginx-proxy service is up and running before running {PRODUCT_NAME}.

== Further troubleshooting

If you're continuing to have issues with {PRODUCT_NAME}, we encourage you to contact other users on our https://latest.cortezaproject.org[community server].
You'll more than likely find someone who can help you out.
You can also open an issue on our https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-server[cortezaproject/corteza-server] GitHub repository.
