= Backups

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote*: add some example setups; like we have now with a CRON job?
====

We recommend updating your database and uploaded files regularly.
It is also highly recommended to do a database backup before you upgrade to a newer {PRODUCT_NAME} version.

[TIP]
====
You can define a cron job that backups your data to some external storage.
====

== Backup the database

We recommend the use of `mysqldump` tool.
It's builtin to the `db` container (`percona:8.0` image).

[NOTE]
====
If you want to use a different tool to create your backup, you will need to connect to the container or publish MySQL ports.
====

[WARNING]
====
By default, `mysqldump` locks the tables when you run the export.
Table locks might cause issues when running in production, so do keep this in mind.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Do not try to copy raw database files to perform a backup.
It might lead to corrupted data.
====

.Database dump command:
[source,bash]
----
# This will dump the entire database and place it in the dump.sql file.
docker-compose exec -T \
    --env MYSQL_PWD=your-password db \
    mysqldump your-db-name --add-drop-database -u your-username > dump.sql
----

[TIP]
====
You can backup your data without shutting down {PRODUCT_NAME} server.
====

== Restore the database

.Database restore command:
[source,bash]
----
# This will restore the database based on the dump.sql file
docker-compose exec -T \
    --env MYSQL_PWD=your-password db \
    mysql your-db-name -u your-username < dump.sql
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
We recommend that {PRODUCT_NAME} server is shut-down until the restore procedure finishes.
====

== Backup uploaded files

Without object storage service like Min.io, uploaded files are stored directly on the filesystem.
{PRODUCT_NAME} server is storing data to the `/data` directory (if not configured differently with `*_STORAGE_PATH` environmental variables).

You can use any one of the standard file management tools to make a backup copy of the files.

.Compressing files with tar command:
[source,bash]
----
# This will compress all your uploaded files into the backup.tar.bz2 archive
tar -cjf backup.tar.bz2 data/server/
----

== Restore uploaded files

.Uncompromising files from the archive with tar command:
[source,bash]
----
# This will restore your backup.tar.bz2 archive
tar -xjf foo.tar.bz2
----
