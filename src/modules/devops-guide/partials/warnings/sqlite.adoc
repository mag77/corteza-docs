*Potential data loss when using SQLite in memory.*

We strongly recommend you use other DB engines (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
If you are set on using SQLite, make sure to use persistent storage.

The used SQLite driver https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3[mattn/go-sqlite3] re-creates the entire database whenever a new connection is established and drops the whole database when the last connection is closed.

We use SQLite primarily for testing, so this isn't an issue for us.
We will work on a more robust solution in future releases.
