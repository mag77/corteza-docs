= About

https://www.docusign.com/[DocuSign] is a service that allows our clients to sign documents, such as quotes and contracts online.

The extension implements three main components:

{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration::
    Follow the {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration provided in the YAML files to configure your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} namespace.

Authentication::
    The OAuth 2 authentication flow authorizes your application to access DocuSign.

Document signature::
    A set of automation scripts that allow us to send the document into signing, cancel the pending document and check for the signature status.

[IMPORTANT]
====
DocuSign is strict in terms of when your credentials can be used in production.

Make sure that your application complies with their ToS.
====

== Required token scopes

signature::
    This scope allows the token to perform most document-related operations, such as sending the document for signing and cancelling the document's signing.

extended::
    This scope allows us to request new refresh tokens with a full lifetime of ~30days.
