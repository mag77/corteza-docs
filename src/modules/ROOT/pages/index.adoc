The DevOps guide also provides some miscellaneous bits, such as xref:devops-guide:configuration/server.adoc[system] and xref:devops-guide:configuration/corredor.adoc[{APP_AUTOMATION}] configuration references, additional deployment configurations (menu:DevOps guide[Offline deployment] and menu:DevOps guide[Online deployment]), xref:devops-guide:maintenance/backups.adoc[data backups], and xref:devops-guide:maintenance/troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting].

[NOTE]
====
Out of the box we support any system that can run Docker.
If you wish to deploy {PRODUCT_NAME} elsewhere (for example, bare metal) you will need to compile your own binaries.

*DevNote* add some documentation regarding source compiling.
