You can access your settings by hovering over the dropdown menu in the top right corner and clicking settings (next to the panel menu).

The {PRODUCT_NAME} profile setting allows you to view your information and change your password.

To change password, the user must enter the existing password, then enter the new password followed by one last confirmation entry of the new password.

Settings open in a new browser tab, so you can close it once you are done.
