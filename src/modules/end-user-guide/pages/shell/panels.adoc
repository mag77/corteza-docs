= Panels

Panels allow you to split and rearrange your workspace to best suit your needs.
You can display one or more applications (using multiple tabs) by clicking on one of the available applications.

[NOTE]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_SHELL} will remember your layout and selected applications.

To change the panel layout, hover over the panel menu in the top-left corner of your screen (the four squares) and select the layout that you wish to use.

If you open more than one panel, you can resize the panels by dragging the arrow icon in the centre of your screen.
