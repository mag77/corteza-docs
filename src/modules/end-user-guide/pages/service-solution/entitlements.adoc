= Entitlements

The Entitlements page is accessible by clicking on the "Entitlements" under the "Accounts" dropdown in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

Entitlements are types of customer support, such as *phone support* or *email support*.
You can set up entitlements to help support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support or not.

Entitlements are related to an account and a product, and they are eligible for a fixed amount of time (defined by the start and end date).

[TIP]
====
You can define an entitlement template under a product to automatically prefill some of the data.
