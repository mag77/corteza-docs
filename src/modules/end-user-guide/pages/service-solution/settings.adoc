= Settings

The Settings page is accessible by clicking on the "Settings" in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

In the settings page, we can configure some parts of the system to suit our needs better.
Let's go over them.

== Available settings

=== Next number for a KB item

This indicates the next ID that is used for the next KB item (entry).
Unless you are migrating from another system, this value doesn't need to be changed.

=== Default cost per hour

This is used if a department doesn't define its hourly cost or if we don't assign a department to the case update.

[NOTE]
====
We strongly advise that each department explicitly specifies an hourly cost.
====

=== Default department for new ticket

This is the default department that will be assigned to a ticket if no other department is selected.

=== Default time for a case update

This is the default time that is used when working on case updates.

[TIP]
====
You can calculate the average consumed time and use that value here.
====

=== Default support channel id

{PRODUCT_NAME} Service Solution integrates into the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_MESSAGING} application.
Specific events, such as a case update, are sent to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_MESSAGING} channel that is defined in this field.

Here is an example of an automated message update:

> Automatic update. "Ticket#20200914101549730" has been updated: Email: Case: [Ticket#20200914101549730] "Cannot connect the cable to the screen" (type: Outgoing email). Direct link: https://latest.cortezaproject.org/compose/ns/service-solution/pages/111502308285612036/record/161946717564960772

=== Default case link

This is the base URL that will be used when generating links to cases.

[TIP]
====
If you have an external portal that is able to display cases stored by {PRODUCT_NAME}, you can change this link to point to that portal.
====

=== Default case email template

This is the default email template that will be used when generating case emails.

== Step by step configuration

=== Next number for a KB item

If you've migrated from another system, insert the next number that should be used.
If not, you can leave this as it is.

=== Default cost per hour

Enter a default cost that should be used when working on a case update.

=== Default department for new ticket

Select the default department.
If you don't see any departments, you should first create it.

=== Default time for a case update

Enter a default time that should be used when working on a case update.

=== Default support channel id

[NOTE]
====
If you don't wish to send automated messages to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_MESSAGING} application, you can skip this.
====

. Open {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_MESSAGING}, select a channel you wish to use, or create a new one,
. take note of the channel ID (this is the long number at the end of the URL address),
. paste the channel ID into this field.

=== Default case link

. Navigate to the "Pages" of your admin panel,
. find the page called `Record page for module "Case"`,
. copy the page ID (this is the long number at the end of the address -- similar to the above channel ID),
. insert `{APP_COMPOSE_BASE_URL}/ns/service-solution/pages/<page_ID_here>/record`.
For example: `{APP_COMPOSE_BASE_URL}/ns/service-solution/pages/111502308285612036/record`

[TIP]
====
If you have an external portal that is able to display cases stored by {PRODUCT_NAME}, you can change this link to point to that portal.
====

=== Default case email template

Select a default email template that should be used when working on cases.
If you don't see any email templates, you should first create it.
