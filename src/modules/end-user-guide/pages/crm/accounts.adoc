= Accounts

The Accounts page is accessible by clicking on the "Accounts" in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

Accounts are entities (companies or other) that you are doing business with.
Here you can store information such as company size, opportunities and business contact information.

[NOTE]
====
You can create a new account in two ways:

. By clicking on the "Add" button, or
. by converting a lead.
In this case, the account and primary contact inherit the lead data.
====

An account has, just as a lead, an owner.
The "account owner" is the person responsible for the account.

The most important block in accounts is "Opportunities" (potential sales).
To generate a new "Opportunity" for the account, press the "Create new Opportunity from this account".

Other related blocks are:

. *Contacts*: all the contacts related to the account.
. *Contracts*: all contracts, active or inactive related to the account.
. *Cases*: All cases that are related to the account.
. *Notes*, *Events* and *Tasks*.

[NOTE]
====
The primary contact provides contact information when generating documents such as quotes.
