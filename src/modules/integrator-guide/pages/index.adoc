= Integrator Guide
:description: {PRODUCT_NAME} Integrator guide covers all aspects of developing and maintaining custom {PRODUCT_NAME} integrations.
:keywords: integration, integrator, app, application, {PRODUCT_NAME}

The *integrator guide* will help you with the process of creating applications using {PRODUCT_NAME} -- the integration process.

You will receive enough knowledge about *the system*; *the development and maintenance* process to be a match for any integration.

If you can not access specific parts of {PRODUCT_NAME}, you don't have sufficient permissions.

== Review the terminology

Before starting our journey, we strongly recommend you xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/terminology.adoc[*review our terminology*].

It will help you keep up with what we are *talking about*, help you *understand the system*, and *keep you consistent*.

== Overview the security system

xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/security.adoc[*Reviewing the security system*] will provide you with an overview of our *access control* system.

It will help with developing *secure applications* and defining *role hierarchies*.

== {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration

The {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration is the *first step of the integration*; it defines *the skeleton* of your application (just like an HTML document represents the page structure).
If the structure is lacking, future development will be challenging.

See the xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/data-model/index.adoc[*{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration section*] to get a good understanding on how you can *define a good foundation* for your application.

== Define an extension

An extension is the *second step of the integration*; it defines *the business logic* of your application (just like a JavaScript document completes a web application).

See the xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/extensions/index.adoc[*extensions section*] to get a good understanding on how you can *define a good extension* for your application.

.We also go into details for the most common questions:
* xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/extensions/index.adoc#extension-deploy[deploying your extensions]
* xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/extensions/index.adoc#extension-test[testing your extensions]
* xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/extensions/index.adoc#extension-debug[debugging your extensions]

== References

Refer to xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/resource-events-reference.adoc[*resource events*] for a complete *list of events* your automation scripts *can listen for*.

Refer to xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/resource-constraints-reference/index.adoc[*resource constraints*] for a complete *list of resource constraints* you can use in your automation script triggers.

== Samples

Use xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/samples/index.adoc[these samples] as *a starting point* for your integrations; such as xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/samples/server-scripts/index.adoc[*server script*], and xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/samples/client-scripts/index.adoc[*client script*] samples.

You can use xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/extensions/index.adoc#extension-test-setup-mc[*this project configuration*] as a base for your extension.
The sample project implements *unit testing* along with *code coverage reports*.
