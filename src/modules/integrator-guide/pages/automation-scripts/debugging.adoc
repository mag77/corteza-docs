[NOTE]
====
*DevNote*: Add some insight in debugging failing scripts.
====

== Why is this script not valid?

.An automation script is valid if:
* it is defined in a `.js` file,
* it is located under `client-scripts` or `server-scripts`,
* it defines an `export default {...}`,
* defines at least one valid trigger,
* defines a security context if it the script is a sink or deferred,
* conforms to the script signature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the case of a *client-script*, make sure that the *file structure* is appropriate.
====

== Why can't I see my scripts?

.Check:
* that the {APP_AUTOMATION} container has access to the extension,
** either via an *existing volume*, or a *new volume*.
* that you've uploaded your source files to your server,
* that you've reloaded your containers.

[TIP]
====
If you're registering a new volume, you must use `docker-compose up -d`

If you're using an existing volume, you can use `docker-compose restart`
