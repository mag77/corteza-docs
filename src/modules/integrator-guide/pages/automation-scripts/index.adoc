= Automation scripts

*DevNote* this page provides enough context to be able to develop scripts.
Additional details (testing, debugging, deploying, ...) are broken down into additional sections.

We define a set of *automation scripts*, *resources* and *other assets* (system and {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configurations) as an extension.

[TIP]
====
You can use our xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/samples/index.adoc[*samples*], and <<extension-test,*testing template*>> to get setup faster.
====

.To define a new extension, firstly *initialize a new node.js project* and define the *appropriate file structure*:
[source,text]
----
/package.json
/...
/server-scripts
  /...
/client-scripts
  /auth
      /...
  /admin
      /...
  /compose 
      /...
  /messaging
      /...
  /shared
      /...
----

`/...` indicates that you are *free to structure* your files as you see fit.

`/auth`, `/admin`, `/compose`, and `/messaging` contain scripts specific to each *web application*.

`/shared` contains code that *client scripts can reuse*.

[NOTE]
====
We recommend *grouping automation scripts* based on their *context*.
For example, scripts working over *leads* could go into a *`/lead/` sub-directory*.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When defining *utilities* (and other _tool functions_) inside the `/server-scripts` or `/server-scripts` (*excluding* `/shared`), {APP_AUTOMATION} will *treat* those *as automation scripts* as well.

Most of the time, they will be *invalid*.
Use the `/shared` directories, or define a `/lib` (or similar) at the *root of the extension*.
