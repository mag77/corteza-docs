= Charts

*Charts* let you create beautiful *data visualization*.
It lets you define everything from *simple case-specific* charts, to complex *dashboards*.

== Create a new chart

.To create a new chart:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} page and enter the namespace you wish to edit,
. click on the "Admin panel" in the top right corner,
. navigate to the "Charts" subpage,
. enter the chart name and press the "Add chart" button,
. select one of the chart groups.

.Refer to below sections on how to configure specific chart groups:
* <<chart-config-generic>>,
* <<chart-config-funnel>>,
* <<chart-config-gauge>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You *can not change* the chart group once it is selected.
You will need to *create a new chart*.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only define permissions for existing charts.
====

== Edit a chart

.To edit an existing chart:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} page and enter the namespace you wish to edit,
. click on the "Admin panel" in the top right corner,
. navigate to the "Charts" subpage,
. press on the edit button next to the chart you wish to edit.

.Refer to below sections on how to configure specific chart groups:
* <<chart-config-generic>>,
* <<chart-config-funnel>>,
* <<chart-config-gauge>>.

== Delete a chart

.To delete an existing chart:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} page and enter the namespace you wish to edit,
. click on the "Admin panel" in the top right corner,
. navigate to the "Charts" subpage,
. press on the edit button next to the chart you wish to delete,
. press the "Delete" button and confirm the operation.

[#chart-config-generic]
== Generic chart configuration

.Generic charts include:
* bar chart,
* line chart,
* pie chart,
* doughnut chart.

.Properties:
Chart name::
    *Chart name* defines a user-friendly label for the chart.

Chart handle::
    *Chart handle* defines a system label that is used for internal referencing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.The provided handle must:
include::ROOT:partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]
====

Colour theme::
    *Color theme* allows you to style the data quickly.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that the selected colour theme *provides enough colours* for your dataset.
====

Chart module::
    *Chart module* defines the *module* that will be used as a *data source* (the records).

Chart filters::
    *Chart filters* allows you to *filter the data source* to include only the records you wish to have.
    The dropdown provides a set of the *most common filters*, but you are free to *edit or define your own* by checking the "Customize filter" option.

[NOTE]
====
*Dev note*: reference QL.
====

Y-axis::
    *Y-axis* allows you to *customize the y-axis*.

Dimensions::
    *Dimensions* specify *the data* that will be shown in the graph.
    For example, all of the *records bucketed by month* based on their creation date.

[IMPORTANT]
====
At the moment you can only define *a single dimension*.
====

Metrics::
    *Metrics* specify *the values* that will be shown in the graph.
    For example, *count the records* for the given month and *display a line*.

[TIP]
====
Metrics define a *post-processing function* that lets you do some additional transformations on the outputted values.

.This is a simple JavaScript expression that *must* return a *number* based on two variables:
* `m`: the *previous value*,
* `n`: the *current value*.

.An example that creates an aggregated chart:
[source,js]
----
m ? m + n : n
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When defining a *post-processing function*, the previous value (`m`) is *undefined* for the *first element* of the chart.
====

[#chart-config-funnel]
== Funnel chart configuration

Chart name::
    *Chart name* defines a user-friendly label for the chart.

Chart handle::
    *Chart handle* defines a system label that is used for internal referencing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.The provided handle must:
include::ROOT:partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]
====

Colour theme::
    *Color theme* allows you to style the data quickly.

Chart reports::
    A *chart report* defines a series of *items to show* in the funnel.

Report module::
    The *report module* defines the *module* that will be used as a *data source* (the records).

Report filter::
    The *report filter* allows you to *filter the data source* to include only the records you wish to have.
    The dropdown provides a set of *most common filter*, but you are free to *edit or define your own* by checking the "Customize filter" option.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote*: reference QL.
====

Report dimension::
    The *report dimension* specify *the data* that will be shown in the graph.
    For example, all of the records bucketed by month based on their creation date.

Report metrics::
    The *report metrics* specify *the values* that will be shown in the graph.
    For example, *count the records* for the given month and *display a line*.

[#chart-config-gauge]
== Gauge chart configuration

Chart name::
    *Chart name* defines a user-friendly label for the chart.

Chart handle::
    *Chart handle* defines a system label that is used for internal referencing.

Gauge charts can only show a *single dimension*.
====

Metrics::
    *Metrics* specify *the values* that will be shown in the graph.
