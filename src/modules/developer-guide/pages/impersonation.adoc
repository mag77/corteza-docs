= Impersonation

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* this will be improved with the developer-guide refactor.
====

Users with sufficient permissions use the impersonation feature to log-in as another user without knowing their password.
A particular role can be allowed to impersonate all users or a particular one.

All impersonations *are recorded* in the *action log*.

[NOTE]
====
The impersonation feature is currently only available via the API.
