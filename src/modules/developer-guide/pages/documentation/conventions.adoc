[#documentation-conventions]
= Conventions

Use the following conventions as a *reference* when you wish to do some extra *formatting* to your documents.

The bellow list is aggregated from https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc], shortened and adjusted to our needs.

Please *follow the* below *conventions* when contributing to the documentation.

== Composition

When composing documents that will be *consumed from a device*, it is essential to *define a stable*, *easy to understand*, and *compact structure*.
Here are a few tips to help you out:

Visually group things::
    Use *paragraphs*, *lists*, *admonition blocks*, and other blocks to visually group things that fit together.
    If something is not relevant in this section but is appropriate in the next one, move it there.

Use formatting to break monotone text::
    Use *bold*, *italic*, *links*, *inline code blocks*, and other formatting to expose the crucial bits for that paragraph.
    *Do not go overboard*.

== Lists

Use lists to give the document some *additional structure*, *outline* the * essential bits*, or show a *sequence* of things.

.General rules:
* Try to keep them *as short as possible*, as they can make it harder to read.
* If a list item is a *proper sentence*, start with a *capital letter*, and end with a *period*.
* If a list item is *not* a *proper sentence*, start with a *lowercase letter*, and (optionally) end with a *comma*.
* Do not mix proper sentences and non-proper sentences.

.Example of a proper sentence; the outline of our documents:
* The *end-user guide* talks about things relevant to the end-users.
* The *integrator guide* talks about creating new things based on the {PRODUCT_NAME}.
* The *developer guide* helps the core developers keep track on how to maintain different features.

.Example of a not-proper sentence; you should know how to use:
* Golang,
* JavaScript,
* VueJS.

=== Ordered lists

List items in an *ordered list* should *start with a dot* (`. ...content here...`) instead of an actual number (it gets assigned at compile-time).
For example:

[source,adoc]
----
.Here we can see:
. list item 1,
. list item 2.
----

=== Unordered lists

List items in an *unordered list* should *start with a star* (`* ...content here...`).
For example:

[source,adoc]
----
.Here we can see:
* list item 1,
* list item 2.
----

[TIP]
====
If your list items are long, try to restructure your section, or use multi-line description blocks.
====

=== Multi-line description blocks

Use description blocks when your *lists* start *getting long*.
They firstly present the *key point* of the block, followed by a more *detailed description*.

[source,adoc]
----
// Make the key point outline the full description.
// Use four spaces to indent the description.
[Key point here]::
    [Description here].
----

For example:

[source,adoc]
----
== Corteza documentation structure

DevOps guide::
    The DevOps guide covers all of the DevOps related bits, such as deploying and maintaining.
    ...

End-user guide::
    The end-user guide serves as a reference for end-users that need help with using the Corteza's user interface.
    ...

Integrator guide::
    The integrator guide serves as a reference for integrators -- people that want to build things with Corteza.
    ...

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Try not to overuse this.
If your descriptions are *getting long* and feel like they should be in a *new sub-section* -- do that instead.
====

== Code snippets

=== Short one-liners

Use *short one-liners* when you wish to show specific *things inline*, such as *CLI commands*, object *properties*, and *variables*.

=== Longer code snippets

When working on examples or longer code snippets, use the source code syntax; `[source,{language here}]`; blocked with four dashes `----`.
For example:

// We'll allow this exception here
```
[source,adoc]
----
// Things go here
----
```

== Admonition

Use the *admonition block* syntax when wanting to create admonitions; where you want *extra attention*.
For example:

[source,adoc]
----
[IMPORTANT]
====
This is *very* important!
====
----

.You can use; they are self-explanatory:
* `NOTE`
* `TIP`
* `IMPORTANT`
* `WARNING`
* `CAUTION`

== Diagrams

*Use the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML]* framework for any diagrams (unless there is an explicit reason why not).
This allows us to *keep things consistent*, *easy to maintain*, and *preserve version history*.

[TIP]
====
Move *larger diagrams* into *separate files* to avoid clutter and unreadable source.
====

// This here is also an exception
```
.Provide a good caption to summarize the *entire* diagram. You can't multi-line captions, so we'll allow it like this here.
[plantuml,diagram-name-here,svg,role=diagram-name]
----
@startuml

' Diagram definition goes here

@enduml
----
```

[TIP]
====
Larger diagrams can get a bit messy to understand what is going on, so do your best to *group elements together*, and use a nice *comment* to indicate it.
====

Diagram captions::
    A caption *must be enough* for the reader to know *what's going on* in the diagram.
    Make sure that the caption gives the reader enough insight to have an idea *what they can expect* to learn *from the diagram*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We are quite strict in having *1 sentence per line* to have nicer version history.
Here, however, I am unable to figure out how/if this is possible.
You are *free to inline your captions* (for now).
====

Comments::
    A PlantUML comment starts with `'` (single line), or is enclosed between `/'`, and `'/`.
    We'll use the following notation to be consistent:

[source,adoc]
----
' ---------------
' Define comments like so.
' Multiple lines are fine.
' ---------------
----

Diagram structure::
    You are free to use any diagram, and any component defined by the diagram.
    *Avoid visual customization* using *Skinparam*.

== Referencing

Use referencing to *link different bits* of information.
We use *two different types* of references:

Page cross-references::
    *Page cross-references* allow us to link *between different documentations*, or even different versions.
    Use the `xref` macro (https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/asciidoc/page-to-page-xref/[The Antora documentation]):

[source,adoc]
----
// Template
xref:ROOT:guide-goes-here/path-to-source.adoc[label-goes-here]

// For example:
xref:ROOT:end-user-guide/messaging/index.adoc[{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_MESSAGING}]
----

[TIP]
====
You can also use *anchors* in your `xref`s.
====

Same page references::
    *Same page references* allow us to link in the same documentation section.
    use the simple page ID reference syntax (https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/asciidoc/in-page-xref/[The Antora documentation]):

[source,adoc]
----
// Define a section ID (make sure that it starts with a #)
[#id-goes-here]

// Reference the section ID (there is no # here)
<<id-goes-here>>

// Reference the section ID with a custom label (no space after the comma)
<<id-goes-here,custom-label-goes-here>>
----

=== Important notes

Same page references are simple::
    Same page references can *only link* to things that are *on the current page*.
    If you try to link to something that is *not on the screen*, the link *will not work*.
    Use *page cross-references*.

Keep section ID's simple::
    Section ID's are relevant *only for the given page*.
    They don't need to be *unique* across the entire documentation, just *for the current page*.
    Example: `[#extension-deployment]`

Don't go overboard::
    If somesomething is *required for the understanding* of the given section, add a *quick summary* and link to the complete document afterwards.
