The sample feature implements a brand new monitoring system for all devices connected to the core system; their availability and memory consumption.
The feature defines a new API, a new database schema and a modern web app.

The web app implements a pulling system, that periodically fetches the system information, sends it over the API and stores it in the database.
Besides storage, the API also allows fetching, updating and deleting the data.
