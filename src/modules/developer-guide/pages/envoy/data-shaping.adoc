= Data shaping

*Data shaping* lets us *define templates* how some input source should be *shaped* (processed) before being encoded.

The data shaping layer takes in a generic `ResourceDataset` structure and a *resource template* structure and produces an actual resource structure.

For example, we provide a `ResourceDataset` structure and a `ComposeRecordTemplate` structure.
The data shaping layer creates a proper `ComposeRecord` structure based on the provided template

Data shaping is useful for *unstructured sources* (such as .csv) where we *can't automatically extract* contextual information (such as what module and namespace to use).
