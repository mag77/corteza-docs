= Dependency graph

The *dependency graph* is the heart of the system, as it lets us *determine the order* in which the *resources should be processed in*.

The dependency graph is the result of the <<builder,graph builder>>.

[NOTE]
====
The graph is a simplified cookie-cutter graph theory implementation, and we won't go into details there.
====

[#graph-builder]
.Graph building flow outline:
. Create an <<builder-initial,initial dependency graph>> that can be used for structured preprocessing.
. Run a series of <<builder-preparer,preprocessing operations>> over the initial dependency graph.
. Create a <<builder-final,final dependency graph>> that is used by the encoder.

[#builder-initial]
== Initial dependency graph

The *graph builder* firstly constructs an *initial dependency graph* based on the constraints defined by the xref:ROOT:developer-guide/envoy/resources.adoc[resource structures].

The initial graph is *temporary* and is used by any preprocessing operations.
This simplifies preprocessing operations, as their *execution is structured* and they don't need to worry about any potentially missing dependency.

[#builder-preparer]
== Preprocessing operations

*Preprocessing operations* can additionally affect how the final dependency graph may look like.
Resources can further define dependencies or even remove obsolete dependencies.

[TIP]
====
This is especially useful for records, as we may not know what other modules they relate to (the module defines that).
====

[#builder-final]
== Final dependency graph

The xref:ROOT:developer-guide/envoy/encoder.adoc[*resource encoding*] layer uses the *final dependency graph*.

You can also define any other operation with the resulting dependency graph.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the dependency graph is valid if you decide to do any manual transformations to it.
