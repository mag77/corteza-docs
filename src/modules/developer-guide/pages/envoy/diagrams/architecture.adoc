package "Decoder layer" as dc {
  [yaml] as dcyml
  [csv] as dccsv
  [store] as dcstore
  note as ndc
  A decoder takes in a set of sources
  and returns a set of resource and
  template nodes.
  end note
}

' Data shaping

package "Data shaping layer" as shaperLayer {
  [Shaper] as shaper

  note as nshaperLayer
  The data shaping layer takes in raw datasets
  and resource template and produces actual
  resources.
  end note
}

dcDataSrc -down-> shaper

' Graph builder

package "Graph builder" as g {
  [Graph builder] as gbld

  note as ng
  The graph builder performs additional data
  transformations and pre-processing in order
  to construct a final dependency graph.
  end note
}

interface "Dependency graph" as depG

eNodeSet -down-> gbld

' ---------------
' Encoder layer
' ---------------

package "Encoder" as enc {
  [yaml] as encyml
  [csv] as enccsv
  [store] as encstore

  note as nenc
  The encoder layer takes in a dependency graph
  and encodes the data to the specified destination.
  end note
}
