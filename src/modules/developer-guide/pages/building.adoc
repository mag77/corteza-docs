== Node packages

`corteza-js` and `corteza-vue` are bundled using Rollup and released to the npm repository.

== Releasing

All of the main {PRODUCT_NAME} applications are tested and build using Drone CI.
The resulted binaries, bundles - in case of webapp projects - and other assets are placed on https://release.{DOMAIN}.

== Packaging

At the moment we officially only support packing into Docker images.
Built docker images are then pushed to the https://hub.docker.com/u/cortezaproject[DockerHub].

Unofficially, you can use the released packages with a Vagrant box {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-vagrant.

Alternatively you can (build and) install these packages manually, either on the virtual machine or a regular machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Actual releases are done by the core team.
