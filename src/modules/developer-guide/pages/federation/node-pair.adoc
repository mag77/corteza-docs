= Node pairing

*Node pairing* is the process of *establishing a federated network* between two {PRODUCT_NAME} instances (nodes).

Node pairing consists of <<node-identification,*node identification*>> which *identifies the two nodes* -- enables communication; and <<node-handshake,*node handshake*>> which *exchanges authentication credentials* for secure communication.

include::diagrams/node-pairing-full.adoc[]

[#node-identification]
== Node identification

The node identification step *exchanges information* about the nodes required to *establish a connection* (*URL address*, *node name*, and some other *metadata*).

[NOTE]
====
The node identification step *doesn't exchange any authentication tokens* apart from the OTT token.
====

include::diagrams/node-pairing-identification.adoc[]

Node A administrator registers node B and generates a node URI::
    Node registration step *lets node A know about node B*.
    The generated node URI *identifies node A* and looks like this: `corteza://$NODE_ID_A:$OTT@$DOMAIN_A?name=$NAME`.

[NOTE]
====
`$OTT` lets us perform initial authentication when performing <<node-handshake,the handshake below>>.
====

Node A administrator sends the node URI to the node B administrator::
    The transferred *node URI* lets node B administrator quickly *register node A*.

[NOTE]
====
This step is *performed manually* by the node administrators.
The two administrators *should use a secure channel* to exchange this information.
====

Node B administrator registers node A using the node URI::
    Node registration step *lets node B know about node A*.
    Both nodes have been identified and are prepared to perform the <<node-handshake,*node handshake*>>.

[#node-handshake]
== Node handshake

The node handshake step *configures the nodes* and *exchanges authentication tokens* that the nodes use to access protected resources.

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_FEDERATION} leverages {PRODUCT_NAME}'s already established authentication facility, using *system users and JWT tokens* (later referred as a token).

This enables us to *reduce potential security holes* and *leverage our RBAC access control facility*.

[NOTE]
====
All *authentication tokens are unique*, even the ones in the same node pair.
====

include::diagrams/node-pairing-handshake.adoc[]

Node B administrator initializes the handshake with node A::
    Node B initializes the state and generates a `$TOKEN_B` that can be used by node A when accessing protected resources.

Node B sends a handshake request to node A::
    Node A administrator is notified (via email) that node B wishes to establish a federated network.
    The handshake request *must be manually confirmed* by the node A administrator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This request is authenticated by the `$OTT` token (generated in the <<node-identification,node identification>> step), *outside* of the standard *authentication facility*.

The actual authentication tokens authenticate all following requests.
====

Node A administrator confirms the handshake request::
    Node A initializes the state and generates a `$TOKEN_A` that can be used by node B when accessing protected resources.

Node A completes the handshake step::
    Node A sends the generated `$TOKEN_A` to node B with a confirmation that the handshake was successful.
